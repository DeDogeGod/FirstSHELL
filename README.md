### What is textE?

textE is a freeware that is also my first bash script in genral. So it probaly is bad. I made this becuase I used to be a noob at shell and didn't know how to make a new text file in terminal. So I made this for you newbies. Its a software that has a GUI. It makes text files where ever you want it and what ever you wanted to be called. You can do whatever you want to do with it but just don't call it your own.

### How to use

Simple enough just do 

```sh
chmod +x textE.sh (Or whatever you called it)
```

Now run it through by draging and dropping it to your terminal or just going into the folder its in and typing ./textE.sh in terminal.

### Developement

You can literally do anything you want exept calling it your own.
